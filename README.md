# Smart-Attendance-System-Facial-Recognition-
This projects deals with the facial recognition of students and then storing the data in .csv  format. 
It is accomplished by various libraries present in python like opencv, pandas,NumPy . IT uses LBPH and Haar-Cascade Algorithms

There are two phases in Face Recognition Based Attendance System: - 

Face Detection : Face Detection is a method of detecting faces in the images. 
                 It is the first and essential step needed for face recognition. 
                 It mainly comes under object detection like for example car in an image or any face in an image and 
                 can use in many areas such as security, bio-metrics,law enforcement, entertainment, personal safety, etc. 

Face Recognition : Face Recognition is a method of identifying or verifying a person from images and videos that are captured through a camera. 
                  Its Key role is to identify people in photos, video, or in real-time.
